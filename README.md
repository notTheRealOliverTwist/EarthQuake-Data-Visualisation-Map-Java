# EarthQuake-Data-Visualisation-Map-Java
Unfolding map applet visualising various json data

This is used with the java8 sdk. Hence the user must switch to an older version of Java in order for it to run.
Additionally the user should have the processing.core library available to them

Project assignment that is a part of a UC San Diego Java course (Credit). Merely intended to learn the PApplet interface in the event we are exposed to it in the future. Not for current/ future application development purposes

Bug Notes:

Sadly I was unable to find a way to create a static map window. Hence when panning around the map tends to move around the screen window. Users may feel free to edit this and post updates should they wish.
